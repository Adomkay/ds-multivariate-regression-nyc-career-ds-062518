# Multivariate Regression
We've looked at the simple linear regression case of predicting one variable from another. 
Now it's time to expand upon that case and begin exploring mutlivariate functions.  
Here we'll use matrices to represent our data of multiple features and observances and apply our knowledge of dot product and other operations to fit a more complex model.
